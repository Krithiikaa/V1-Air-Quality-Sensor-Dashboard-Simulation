# 🌫️ Advanced Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard (Simulated Version)

This project is a professional-grade, interactive air quality monitoring dashboard designed using **Tailwind CSS**, **Chart.js**, and **SheetJS**. It displays dynamic, real-time sensor values (simulated), rich visual elements, and supports Excel export. Inspired by the sleek UI of platforms like Perplexity, it mimics real-world monitoring dashboards with clean UX and responsive layout.
